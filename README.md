Install from thunderstore either manually or using r2modman OR build from source and manually add the mod to your plugins folder

# Known issues

- 7-4 Isn't compatible right now, but you can use the global space to change the songs manually. Proper support coming soon.
- Secret levels don't work yet, but it could be possible that using the global sound replacement, they could work
