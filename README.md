# USTManager

This is the successor to UKMusicReplacement, built from scratch to be easier to work with

# Installation

Install from thunderstore either manually or using r2modman OR build from source and manually add the mod to your plugins folder

# Known issues

- 7-4 Isn't compatible for a reason, It uses a ton of different audioclips to make the full song, which i didn't bother to patch and i doubt anyone would have spent that much time making custom tracks for it
- Secret levels don't work yet, but it could be possible that using the global sound replacement, they could work
- P-2 Isn't compatible at the moment but is planned

# Roadmap

- Missing levels
- More debug options for soundtrack makers
- UST stacking/mixing
- Sorting in the menu
- Shuffle
