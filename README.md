# USTManager

This is the successor to UKMusicReplacement, built from scratch to be easier to work with

# Installation

Install from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/ZedDev/USTManager/) either manually or using r2modman OR build from source and manually add the mod to your plugins folder

# Known issues

- Secret levels don't work directly, but using the global sound replacement should work

# Roadmap

- UST Editor
- Sorting in the menu
- Shuffle (i'm not that sure about this one)
