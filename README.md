# USTManager

This is the successor to UKMusicReplacement, built from scratch to be easier to work with

# Installation

Install from thunderstore either manually or using r2modman OR build from source and manually add the mod to your plugins folder

# Known issues

- Secret levels don't work yet, but it could be possible that using the global sound replacement, they could work
- Some sounds can't be replaced. Actively looking for a solution (Patching all sources Awake methods, which Harmony can't do because AudioSource.Awake doesn't exist according to Harmony)

# Roadmap

- UST Editor
- Sorting in the menu
- Shuffle
